# Speech-Recognition-Bar-Scenario
This program has been done by using spacy, nltk, speech recognition libraries in order to realize dialog in the bar between bot
and user. 

Project has 3 parts which are:

default_settings.py:
It involves related default speech recognition functions for initializing microphone, setting the recognizer and transforming
the text to the speech.
natural_language_settings.py:
It involves functions which are related to natural language and dependency parsing. Tokenization of the sentences, extracting
convenient patterns, nouns are done in this file.
main.py:
This file is the main file that, menu and some default initializations can be changed or resetted. Order is asked from the 
user in here, checking the emptyness and convenience of the order has been done in the main while loop. 
Note: If you want to terminate the code, you can use one of the keywords from the list of rejection while bot is asking you  
to give an order. This will make the project terminate.
